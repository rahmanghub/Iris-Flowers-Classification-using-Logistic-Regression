## Iris Flowers Classification using Logistic Regression

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify different species of Iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. We will be using a dataset containing various features of Iris flowers along with their corresponding species labels. The machine learning model will be trained on this data using Logistic Regression to learn the patterns and relationships between the features and flower species, and then used to make predictions on new data.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (target variable)

This dataset consists of various measurements of Iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species labels. The species labels indicate the different types of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. We will use this data to build a machine learning model for Iris flowers classification using Logistic Regression.

### Libraries Used

We will be using the following Python libraries for this project:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For data visualization
- seaborn: For advanced data visualization
- scikit-learn: For implementing the logistic regression model and evaluation
